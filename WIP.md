## Background

Some folks [expressed an interest][masto-convo-claim-a-page-range] in
claiming a range of pages to transcribe while wanting to avoid wasting
time working on the same range as another person.  This makes some sense
because transcribing these pages is slow going, and making a commitment
to working on some pages is usually easier than finding the time to do
the keyboard work!  *(embarrassed cough)*

If you'd like to sign up for a page or a range of pages *and* announce
your intention to do so, please submit a PR with your name and range in
the **Claims** section above, on the [`master`][gh-master-branch]
branch.  I'll merge that ASAP.

When your transcription is done, please file a PR against the
[`integrate`][gh-integrate-branch] branch.  We'll work through that
together, with as short a feedback cycle as we can manage, and I'll
merge it back into `master` not long after.

  @gnomon I want to help transcribe furby.asm, but also don't want to
  waste time working on pages someone else has already done but not
  commited. Should we use the issues/wiki on github to 'claim' pages
  we're working on?"
